Problem: Getting ugly shadows around tiny pie charts.
 
Solution: In palette select Theme as “aegean”
 
We will get this following error
 
Caused by: net.sf.jasperreports.engine.JRRuntimeException: Chart theme ‘aegean’ not found.
 
We need to add to the pom file.
 jasperreports-chart-themes-3.6.x.jar
 castor-1.2.jar
 spring-core-2.5.5.jar
 spring-beans-2.5.5.jar
 
Maven is not pulling them from repository.
 We need to install.
